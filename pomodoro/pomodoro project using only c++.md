The purpose of this project is to create our very first daemon that will send notification to the user to tell him when he can take either a break or work time. 
The configuration are based into a `.cfg` file that will be parsed to retrieve the value that the user has changed.

# how to run the program 
```bash
make && make install-service

#producing this output
