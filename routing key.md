A routing key is like the `address label` we slap on a package when sending it somewhere, it's used to direct a message or data to the correct destination.
In computer science and system design, it's mostly used in messaging systems like:
- `RabbitMQ / Kafka`
-  [[event-drive architecture]]
- [[distributed systems]]
