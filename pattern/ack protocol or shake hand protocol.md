Yes, an ACK-based protocol works perfectly with your Huffman protocol, checksum, and hash table. The ACK system is **independent of the data content or encoding**—it simply ensures that every bit (or byte) you send is reliably received and processed by the server before you send the next one.

**How it fits:**

- **Huffman protocol:** The client still encodes the message using Huffman, sends the frequency table, and then the encoded bits. The ACK just ensures each bit/byte is received in order.
- **Checksum:** The checksum is calculated and sent as before. The ACK protocol ensures the bits that make up the checksum are also reliably transmitted.
- **Hash table:** The hash table is used internally for frequency counting and encoding/decoding. The ACK protocol does not interfere with this logic.

**What changes:**

- After sending each bit (or byte), the client waits for an ACK signal from the server before sending the next.
- The server, after processing each bit, sends an ACK signal back to the client.

**Result:**  
You get 100% reliable, race-free, and lossless transmission, regardless of message size or encoding complexity.

**Summary:**  
The ACK protocol is a transport-layer improvement. It does not affect your Huffman logic, checksum, or hash table. It only makes the delivery of your protocol data robust and reliable.
