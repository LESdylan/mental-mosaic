The function `ft_strlcat` is a custom implementation of the `strlcat` function. It is used to concatenate strings, with an additional safeguard to prevent buffer overflows. Here's an in-depth explanation of how it works:

### Function Breakdown

```c
t_size	ft_strlcat(char *dst, const char *src, t_size dsize)
{
    t_size dest_len;   // Length of the destination string (dst)
    t_size src_len;    // Length of the source string (src)
    t_size i;          // Iterator for copying characters from src to dst
    char *d;           // Pointer to track the position in the destination string (dst)

    // Get the length of the destination string (excluding null terminator)
    dest_len = ft_strlen(dst);

    // Get the length of the source string (excluding null terminator)
    src_len = ft_strlen(src);

    // If the destination size is less than or equal to the length of the destination,
    // the result will be the size of the destination + the length of the source.
    if (dsize <= dest_len)
        return (dsize + src_len);

    // Point 'd' to the end of the destination string (i.e., after the null terminator)
    d = dst + dest_len;

    // Copy characters from src to dst while ensuring that we do not exceed the buffer
    // size (dsize - dest_len - 1) and stop when we reach the end of src or fill the buffer.
    i = -1;
    while (++i < dsize - dest_len - 1 && *src)
        *d++ = *src++;

    // Add the null terminator at the end of the destination string
    *d = '\\0';

    // Return the total length of the string that would have been created (including null terminator).
    return (dest_len + src_len);
}

```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Calculating Lengths**:
    - The function first calculates the lengths of both the destination (`dst`) and the source (`src`) strings using `ft_strlen`. This will help in determining where to append the source string and whether the destination buffer is large enough to fit the result.
2. **Check Buffer Size**:
    - It checks whether the total size of the destination buffer (`dsize`) is sufficient to hold the concatenated string (destination + source). If `dsize` is smaller than or equal to `dest_len`, it means the destination buffer can't accommodate the concatenation safely, so the function returns `dsize + src_len`. This allows the caller to know how much space would be required for the operation.
    - If `dsize` is large enough, the function proceeds to append the source string to the destination string.
3. **Point to the End of Destination**:
    - A pointer `d` is set to point to the end of the current destination string (`dst + dest_len`).
4. **Copying Characters**:
    - The function enters a `while` loop that copies characters from `src` to `dst` as long as there is space in the destination buffer. The buffer size available for copying is `dsize - dest_len - 1` (because we need space for the null-terminator). The loop continues copying until either the space runs out or the source string ends.
5. **Null-Termination**:
    - After copying characters, the function adds a null-terminator (`'\\0'`) at the end of the concatenated string to ensure that the resulting string is properly terminated.
6. **Return Value**:
    - The function returns the total length of the string that would have been produced, which is the sum of `dest_len` (the length of the destination string) and `src_len` (the length of the source string). This helps the caller determine whether the concatenation has been truncated.

### Key Details:

- **`dsize`**: The total size of the destination buffer. It's important to ensure that there is space left in the buffer to avoid overflow. The function checks that `dsize` is greater than `dest_len` before proceeding with the copy operation.
- **Return Value**:
    - If the buffer size (`dsize`) is too small, the function returns the size that would have been required for the concatenation (`dsize + src_len`).
    - Otherwise, it returns the total length of the concatenated string, which is `dest_len + src_len`.

### Example:

Let's go through an example to understand the function better:

- **Input**:
    - `dst = "Hello"`
    - `src = " World"`
    - `dsize = 15`
- **Step-by-step**:
    - `dest_len = ft_strlen(dst)` → `5` (length of "Hello")
    - `src_len = ft_strlen(src)` → `6` (length of " World")
    - The destination buffer has enough space (`dsize = 15`).
    - The function will copy up to `dsize - dest_len - 1 = 15 - 5 - 1 = 9` characters from `src` into `dst`.
    - It will append `" World"` to `"Hello"`, resulting in `"Hello World"`.
    - The function returns `dest_len + src_len = 5 + 6 = 11`.
- **Output**:
    - `dst` will now contain `"Hello World"`.
    - The function returns `11`.

### Summary:

- **Purpose**: To concatenate two strings while preventing buffer overflow and ensuring null-termination.
- **Key Operations**:
    - It checks if the destination buffer is large enough.
    - It copies characters from `src` to `dst` up to the available space.
    - It ensures the resulting string is null-terminated.
- **Return Value**: The total length of the string that would have been created (including null-terminator), which can be used to check if truncation occurred.
