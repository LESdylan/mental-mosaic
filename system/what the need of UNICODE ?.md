- in *Real world application*: Modern application and users expect to send and receive messages in many languages and scripts, not just ASCII. Supporting Unicode means that our project can handle accented letters, non-latin scripts, emojis, and symbols used worldwide.

Beside understanding unicode require understanding `UTF-8` encoding, which uses 1 to 4 bytes per character. This adds a layer of complexity to the bitwise signal protocol making the project more realistic and challenging exercice in low-level data transmission

supporting unicode show that our code can be extensible and will be able to tallk in any language.
