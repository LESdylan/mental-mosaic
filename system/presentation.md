Yes, the need for "extra care" regarding memory leakage varies significantly between programming languages, primarily based on how they manage memory.

1. **Manual Memory Management (e.g., C, C++):**
    - **High Care Needed:** These languages require the programmer to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory (e.g., `malloc`/`free` in C, `new`/`delete` in C++).
    - **Leaks are Common:** Forgetting to `free` or `delete` allocated memory is a common source of memory leaks. Tools like Valgrind are essential.
    - **Dangling Pointers/Double Frees:** Besides leaks, incorrect manual management can lead to other critical errors like dangling pointers or double frees.
2. **Automatic Memory Management / Garbage Collection (e.g., Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Swift (with ARC), Lisp):**
    - **Less Direct Care for Memory Leaks:** These languages have a "garbage collector" (GC) or a similar mechanism (like Automatic Reference Counting in Swift/Objective-C) that automatically reclaims memory that is no longer referenced by the program.
    - **Traditional Memory Leaks are Rare:** The most common type of memory leak seen in C (where allocated memory is forgotten and no longer pointed to) is largely eliminated by the GC.
    - **"Logical" Leaks or Loitering Objects Still Possible:** Even with a GC, you can still have situations that behave like leaks:
        - **Loitering Objects (or Unintentional Object Retention):** If you keep references to objects that are no longer needed (e.g., in a global list, a cache that never clears old entries), the GC cannot reclaim them because they are still "reachable." The program's memory usage will grow unnecessarily. This is the most common form of "leak" in GC languages.
        - **Resource Leaks:** GCs typically manage memory, not other system resources like file handles, network connections, database connections, or graphics resources. If you open these resources and don't explicitly close/release them, they can be leaked, even if the memory for the object holding the resource is eventually collected. Many languages use "try-with-resources" (Java), `with` statements (Python), or `defer` (Go) to help manage this.
    - **GC Overhead:** While GCs prevent many leaks, they can introduce their own performance characteristics, like pauses during garbage collection cycles.
3. **Ownership/Borrowing Systems (e.g., Rust):**
    - **Different Kind of Care:** Rust uses a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. This system is designed to ensure memory safety (no dangling pointers, no data races) without needing a traditional garbage collector.
    - **Memory Leaks are Possible but Harder:** While Rust's ownership system prevents many common memory errors, it's still possible to create reference cycles (e.g., using `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`) that can lead to memory not being deallocated. However, these are less common and often require more explicit constructs. Resource leaks are managed similarly to other languages (e.g., types implementing the `Drop` trait).

**In summary:**

- Languages like **C and C++** demand the most explicit and careful manual memory management to avoid leaks.
- Languages with **garbage collection** significantly reduce the burden of manual memory deallocation, making traditional memory leaks rare. However, developers still need to be mindful of object lifecycles to prevent loitering objects and manage non-memory resources.
- Languages like **Rust** offer memory safety through a compile-time ownership system, which prevents many types of memory errors, including most common leaks, but still requires understanding its rules.
