You're looking at the Valgrind output correctly, and it _is_ telling you about an error, specifically a memory leak.

Let's break down the Valgrind output:

1. **`==431487== HEAP SUMMARY:`**
    - **`==431487== in use at exit: 12 bytes in 1 blocks`**: This is the key line. It means that when your program exited, there were still 12 bytes of memory allocated on the heap that had not been freed.
    - **`==431487== total heap usage: 1 allocs, 0 frees, 12 bytes allocated`**: This confirms that your program made one allocation (your `ft_calloc`) and zero `free` calls.
2. **`==431487== LEAK SUMMARY:`**
    - **`==431487== definitely lost: 12 bytes in 1 blocks`**: This is Valgrind's classification of the leak. "Definitely lost" means Valgrind is sure that you no longer have any pointers to this memory, so it cannot be freed. This is precisely what happens when you allocate memory with `ft_calloc` and don't `free` it before the program ends.
3. **`==431487== Rerun with --leak-check=full to see details of leaked memory`**: This is a helpful suggestion from Valgrind. If you run `valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program ...`, it will give you a stack trace showing where the leaked memory was allocated.
4. **`==431487== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)`**:
    - This line can be a bit misleading if you're only looking for the word "ERROR" in big letters.
    - Valgrind categorizes issues. "Definitely lost" memory is a type of error (a memory leak), but Valgrind reports it under the "LEAK SUMMARY."
    - The "ERROR SUMMARY" often refers to more direct memory errors like writing to unallocated memory, using uninitialized values in conditional jumps, invalid reads/writes, etc.
    - **A memory leak _is_ an error.**

**Why Valgrind says "0 errors" in the summary but reports a leak:**

Valgrind distinguishes between different kinds of memory problems.

- **Memory Leaks:** Memory that was allocated but not freed. Valgrind reports these under "LEAK SUMMARY" and often flags them as "definitely lost," "indirectly lost," or "possibly lost."
- **Memory Errors:** These are more direct violations like:
    - Invalid read/write (e.g., buffer overflows, accessing freed memory).
    - Use of uninitialized values.
    - Mismatched `malloc`/`free` or `new`/`delete`.
    - Invalid `free()` (e.g., double free, freeing a non-heap address).

Your current code, _before adding `free()`_, only has the memory leak. It doesn't (apparently, from this Valgrind run) have other types of memory errors like buffer overflows or using uninitialized values in a way that Valgrind detects as an immediate error.

**So, Valgrind _did_ send you an error message: the "definitely lost: 12 bytes in 1 blocks" is the error.**

Once you add `free(arr_start);` at the end of your `main` function (before `return (0);`), and rerun Valgrind, you should see the "definitely lost" message disappear, and the "in use at exit" should become 0 bytes.
