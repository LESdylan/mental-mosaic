Okay, let's break down this Valgrind log step by step. This log is excellent because it shows a common error and how Valgrind helps you pinpoint it.

- **`==620193==`**: This is the Process ID (PID) that Valgrind is monitoring. All lines related to this run will have this prefix.
- **`Memcheck, a memory error detector`**: Tells you which Valgrind tool is being used. Memcheck is the default and most common one for finding memory errors.
- **Copyright and Version Info**: Standard information.
- **`Command: ./push_swap 1 2 3`**: Shows the command you executed.

- This is the standard output (`stdout`) from your program, specifically from your `ft_printf` and `ft_print_array` calls. This part shows your program was running and processing the input as expected up to a point.

==620193==

- **`==620193== Invalid read of size 4`**: This is the **critical error message**.
    - "Invalid read": Your program tried to read from a memory location it shouldn't have.
    - "size 4": It attempted to read 4 bytes. Since your `arr` is an `int *`, and `sizeof(int)` is typically 4 bytes on most systems, this means it tried to read an integer.
- **`==620193== at 0x10929E: main (in /home/dlesieur/Documents/projects-42/Push_swap/dylan/push_swap)`**: This is the **stack trace** showing where the error occurred.
    - `0x10929E`: The memory address of the instruction in your code that caused the error.
    - `main`: The function where the error happened.
    - `(in /home/dlesieur/Documents/projects-42/Push_swap/dylan/push_swap)`: The executable file.
    - **This points directly to the line `printf("%d", *arr);` in your `main` function.**
- **`==620193== Address 0x4a8f04c is 0 bytes after a block of size 12 free'd`**: This gives crucial context about the invalid memory address.
    - `Address 0x4a8f04c`: The specific memory address your program tried to read from.
    - `is 0 bytes after a block of size 12 free'd`: This tells you that the address `0x4a8f04c` was _just at the end_ of a 12-byte block of memory that had _already been freed_.
        - Your `len` was 3 (for "1 2 3"). `sizeof(int)` is 4. So, `len * sizeof(int)` is `3 * 4 = 12` bytes. This was the size of your `arr_start` allocation.
        - The pointer `arr` was incremented `len` times (`(arr++) = number;`). So, after the loop, `arr` points to the memory location immediately _after_ the 12-byte block allocated for `arr_start`.
- **`==620193== at 0x484988F: free (in [vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so](http://_vscodecontentref_/0))`** **`==620193== by 0x109299: main (in /home/dlesieur/Documents/projects-42/Push_swap/dylan/push_swap)`**: This tells you where the memory block was freed.
    - The `free` call was made from your `main` function (at address `0x109299`), which corresponds to your `free(arr_start);` line.
- **`==620193== Block was alloc'd at`**: This tells you where the memory block (that was later freed and then invalidly read) was originally allocated.
    - **`==620193== at 0x4846828: malloc (in [vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so](http://_vscodecontentref_/1))`**
    - **`==620193== by 0x1096BF: ft_calloc (in /home/dlesieur/Documents/projects-42/Push_swap/dylan/push_swap)`**
    - **`==620193== by 0x109206: main (in /home/dlesieur/Documents/projects-42/Push_swap/dylan/push_swap)`**: This stack trace shows the allocation happened inside your `ft_calloc` function, which was called by `main`. This corresponds to `arr = ft_calloc(len, sizeof(int));`.

**Connecting to your code:** The error happens at `printf("%d", *arr);`.

1. You allocate memory and `arr_start` points to its beginning. `arr` also initially points there.
2. In the loop, `(arr++) = number;` stores a number and then increments `arr`. After 3 numbers, `arr` points just _past the end_ of the allocated block.
3. `free(arr_start);` deallocates the memory block that `arr_start` (and originally `arr`) pointed to.
4. `printf("%d", *arr);` then tries to dereference `arr`. `arr` is now a **dangling pointer**. It points to memory that has been freed (and in this case, it points just off the end of that freed block). This is an invalid read.

0==620193==

- This `0` is the output from your `printf("%d", *arr);`. Because you're reading from freed (and potentially uninitialized or reused) memory, the value you get is garbage. In this case, it happened to be 0. It could be anything.

==620193== HEAP SUMMARY:

==620193==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

==620193==   total heap usage: 2 allocs, 2 frees, 1,036 bytes allocated

==620193==

- **`in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks`**: This is good! It means all memory allocated on the heap by your program was eventually freed.
- **`total heap usage: 2 allocs, 2 frees, 1,036 bytes allocated`**:
    - `2 allocs, 2 frees`: Your `ft_calloc` is one allocation. Valgrind might be reporting another small allocation made internally by `printf` or other library functions, which was also freed.
    - `1,036 bytes allocated`: Total memory managed by the heap during the program's run.

==620193== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible

==620193==

- This confirms the HEAP SUMMARY: you don't have memory leaks. This is because your `free(arr_start);` call worked. The error is not a leak, but an invalid read _after_ a free.

==620193== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s

==620193== ERROR SUMMARY: 1 errors from 1 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

- **`ERROR SUMMARY: 1 errors from 1 contexts`**: This summarizes that Valgrind found one distinct type of error (the "Invalid read").

**In short: Valgrind is telling you that on the line `printf("%d", *arr);`, you are trying to read from memory that you have already `free`d, and specifically from a location (`arr`) that was pointing just past the end of that freed block.**
