Yes, it is a **highly recommended best practice** to set a pointer to `NULL` immediately after freeing the memory it points to.

While not strictly required by the C standard for the `free()` function to work (the memory is deallocated regardless), doing so helps prevent common and hard-to-debug errors:

1. **Prevents Dangling Pointers:**
    - After `free(ptr);`, the `ptr` variable still holds the same memory address. This address now points to deallocated memory. If you accidentally use this "dangling pointer" later (e.g., dereference it or pass it to another function), it leads to **undefined behavior**. This could be a crash, corrupted data, or seemingly random errors.
    - Setting `ptr = NULL;` immediately after `free(ptr);` ensures that if you accidentally try to use `ptr` again, you'll be dereferencing a `NULL` pointer. On most systems, this will cause an immediate and obvious crash (like a segmentation fault), making the bug much easier to find than the unpredictable behavior of a dangling pointer.
2. **Prevents Double Free Errors:**
    - Calling `free()` on a pointer that has already been freed (and not set to `NULL`) is undefined behavior and can corrupt the heap.
    - However, calling `free(NULL);` is a safe and well-defined no-operation.
    - If you set `ptr = NULL;` after the first `free`, then an accidental second call `free(ptr);` will be harmless.
3. **Clearer Code Intent:**
    - It makes it explicit in your code that the pointer is no longer valid and should not be used to access memory. This improves code readability and maintainability.

**Example:**

```c
Your code:

// ...existing code...

ft_print_array(arr_start,len,'v');

free(arr_start);

return (0);

}
```
**Improved with setting to NULL:**
```c
// ...existing code...

ft_print_array(arr_start,len,'v');

free(arr_start);

arr_start = NULL; // Good practice!

// If you had other pointers pointing to the same block, they should also be considered invalid.

// In your specific main, 'arr' is also dangling after the loop.

// If 'arr' were to be used after free(arr_start) (which it isn't in this simple case),

// it would also be problematic.

return (0);

}
```

In your specific `main` function, `arr_start` goes out of scope immediately after `free()` and `return (0);`, so the risk of misusing it _within that function_ is low. However, forming the habit is crucial for larger programs and more complex scenarios where pointers might have longer lifetimes or be passed around.

The pointer `arr` in your code also becomes a dangling pointer after the loop (it points past the end of the allocated block). While you don't use `arr` again after the loop in this specific version, if the code were more complex, `arr` would also ideally be reset or its use carefully managed if `arr_start` was freed. However, since `arr_start` is the one holding the base address for `free`, nullifying `arr_start` is the most direct and important step here.
