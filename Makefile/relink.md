In your Makefile, **relinking** is handled based on the use of dependencies and how the `make` tool determines whether the target needs to be rebuilt. Here's a breakdown of how it works in your case:

---

### Key Parts of Relinking

### 1. **`$(NAME)` Target**

```
$(NAME): $(TARGET)
	$(AR) $(NAME) $^
```

- This target builds the static library `libft.a` by archiving the object files listed in `$(TARGET)`.
- The dependency list `$(TARGET)` ensures that all object files are built (`%.o : %.c`) before running the `ar -rc` command to create or update the archive.
- If none of the `.o` files have been modified since the last build, `make` skips this target because it's already up-to-date.

### 2. **Rebuild Logic**

- When `make all` or `make` is run:
    - Each `.o` file is rebuilt only if its corresponding `.c` file or dependencies (e.g., headers) have changed.
    - If none of the `.o` files are rebuilt, `libft.a` will not be re-archived (no relinking).
- If at least one `.o` file changes, `make` will execute:

This recreates the `libft.a` archive by updating it with the modified object files.

````
```
$(AR) $(NAME) $^

```
````

### 3. **Bonus Target**

The `bonus` target combines both `$(TARGET)` and `$(BONUS_TARGET)`:

```
bonus: $(TARGET) $(BONUS_TARGET)
	$(AR) $(NAME) $^
```

- This ensures that both the regular and bonus object files are included in `libft.a`.
- If `make bonus` is invoked after a regular `make` (or `make all`), the `libft.a` archive is relinked to include the `BONUS_TARGET` object files.

---

### 4. **Cleaning Targets**

### `clean` Target

```
clean:
	$(RM) $(TARGET) $(BONUS_TARGET)
```

- Removes all object files (`$(TARGET)` and `$(BONUS_TARGET)`), forcing them to be rebuilt on the next `make` invocation.

### `fclean` Target

```
fclean: clean
	$(RM) $(NAME)
```

- Removes both object files and the `libft.a` archive, ensuring a full rebuild the next time `make` is run.

---

### 5. **Rebuilding with `re` and `rebonus`**

### `re` Target

```
re: fclean all
```

- Executes the `fclean` target, cleaning everything (object files and `libft.a`), and then rebuilds the library (`make all`).

### `rebonus` Target

```
rebonus: fclean bonus
```

- Cleans everything and rebuilds the library including bonus object files.

---

### 6. **Dynamic Library (`so`)**

The `so` target builds a shared library (`libft.so`):

```
so:
	$(CC) -nostartfiles -fPIC $(FLAGS) $(TARGET) $(BONUS_TARGET)
	cc -nostartfiles -shared -o libft.so $(TARGET) $(BONUS_TARGET)
```

- This command compiles all object files with `fPIC` (position-independent code) and links them into a shared object file (`libft.so`).
- The `so` target does not depend on `$(NAME)` or any other target, so itâ€™s completely independent.

---

### Summary of Relinking

Relinking happens under these conditions:

1. If any `.c` file changes, the corresponding `.o` file is rebuilt, triggering the relinking of `libft.a`.
2. If you invoke `make re` or `make rebonus`, everything is cleaned and rebuilt, ensuring that the library is relinked from scratch.
3. The `so` target always rebuilds `libft.so` because it doesn't depend on a specific static state.

If relinking isn't happening as expected, ensure that:

- Dependencies are correctly tracked (`I $(DEPS)`).
- Timestamps on files are accurate (e.g., not altered by system clock issues).
