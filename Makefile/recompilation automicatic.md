# Understanding Makefile Remakes

## What is a Makefile Remake?

A Makefile remake refers to the process where Make determines whether the makefile itself needs to be regenerated before being used. This is particularly important when the makefile is automatically generated from other source files.

## When Does Make Remake the Makefile?

- When the makefile is mentioned as a target in its own rules
- When the makefile has dependencies that are newer than itself
- When explicit remake rules are defined

## Basic Remake Rules

```makefile
Makefile: Makefile.in
    ./config.sh $< > $@

# Multiple prerequisites
Makefile: dep1.in dep2.in
    ./generate_makefile.sh $^ > $@
```

## Important Concepts

- **Automatic Remake:** Make checks if the makefile needs to be remade before processing other targets
- **Prerequisites:** Files that the makefile depends on (like templates or configuration files)
- **Generation Scripts:** Scripts or programs that generate the final makefile

## Best Practices

- Always document makefile generation process
- Use clear dependency chains
- Include error handling in generation scripts
- Test generated makefiles before deployment

## Common Patterns

```makefile
# Pattern using autoconf
Makefile: Makefile.in config.status
    ./config.status

# Pattern using m4 macros
Makefile: Makefile.m4
    m4 $< > $@
```

## Troubleshooting

- Check file timestamps carefully
- Use make -d for debugging remake issues
- Verify all prerequisites exist
- Ensure generation scripts have proper permissions

Remember that makefile remakes are crucial for maintaining build system consistency, especially in projects where build configurations change frequently.
